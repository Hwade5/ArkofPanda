# Music Label

## What is a music label? What can a label do?

A music label is like a big family full of musical charms, allowing players to feel infinite creative fun in a world of endless possibilities.

&#x20;

By joining a Music Label, players can not only find like-minded musicians but also participate in a variety of Label activities. Within the label, players can collaborate with other members to perform, produce music, and create unforgettable musical journeys together. In addition, labels offer players exclusive benefits such as regular competitions, exclusive NFT collections, and even collaboration opportunities with renowned musicians.

&#x20;

Music labels are a great platform to showcase and develop players' musical talents. Players will continue to refine their musical skills by interacting with label members and discovering more creative inspirations. Instead of working alone, players will be part of a dynamic and innovative group that builds a unique musical world together.

&#x20;

Join a music label, enjoy the fun of music creation, and participate in various activities to get unique benefits. It is a temple of music and a musical utopia for players and fellow musicians to explore together.

## Label license wars:

#### **Label Warfare Story:**

Stable state Omix crystal resources can be used to cast VSTs, and stable Omix crystals are only found in extreme pressure environments and have not been found in known natural surface environments, but that was all before Chaos District was discovered. Chaos District has an extensive resource of stable-state Omix crystals, known to be unprecedented in the Utopia realm and within the known Utopia field.

&#x20;

Since the discovery of this area, the question of its ownership has never been adequately resolved. As its name suggests, it is a chaotic place, and all Labels covet its resources, which has led to endless disputes.

Many Labels, with their excellent musical skills, have stood out from the fray and earned their place in the Chaos District, where a large amount of Omix energy has made every label member richer than ever before. But that doesn't mean they can rest on their laurels as rounds of looting ensue.

## Label Exclusive NFT Customisation:

Customization of Label Exclusive Fashion, Carriers, Orpheus, Furniture, etc., is initiated by the Label creator, crafted and shelved in the Label Store, and can be purchased by players within the label by consuming tokens;

&#x20;
