# Event: Inside

## **Event Storyline:**

As the rift in space-time becomes increasingly unstable, Daffy Panda realizes that the city is under threat like never before. They begin to take action to save the town, gathering the collected Omix energy and blasting the rift with its mighty power. After a massive wave of energy, the dangerous separation finally stabilized.

&#x20;

At the same time, the brave Pandas also entered this mysterious rift in time and space. With faith in their feet, they traveled through the rift to an uncharted and unknown area that had never been seen before. This mysterious space where many unseen Orpheus slumbered amongst the crystals as if waiting for some unique touch. This touch comes from the energy of music, and the Daffy Pandas understand that they need to use their musical power to awaken these sleeping Orpheus and unravel more and more of the mystery.

As they went deeper, everyone's eyes began to burn, and some even attacked their other mates!

Wait, something seems wrong about the energy floating through the air.

&#x20;

## **How to Play:**

Players who enter this space and touch other players will enter into a battle directly; the winning player can plunder the points of the losing player; the more significant the difference between the points of the two players, the higher the points of the player who wins will get fewer points, and the lower the points of the player who wins will earn more points.

Players can also consume some unique props to circumvent or strengthen attacks.

* Invisibility Charm (cannot be challenged for a certain period after use)
* Reinforcement Rune (Orpheus damage increase for a certain period)
