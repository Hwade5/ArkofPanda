# The Story of Orpheus

On Utopia, the Daffy Panda Ganging Up organization went all in on Orpheus, a creature that resonates strongly with Omix. Through in-depth research, they discovered that Orpheus can release different waveforms of Omix energy, five in total, namely α, β, γ, δ, and ε. Orpheus' resonance is the highest known resonance with the highest energy conversion rate, which is very exciting to the Daffy Panda Gang.

&#x20;

Establishing a good survival relationship with Orpheus makes Daffy Panda feel the magic of cosmic life. In their symbiotic relationship with Orpheus, they discovered that the interaction between different waveforms can stimulate higher energy conversion. Through domestication and nurturing, they allowed Orpheus to master all five waveforms and become the creature with the highest energy conversion rate, convinced that this would be the best way to solve the Earth's energy crisis.

&#x20;

After years of effort, the solution to the Earth's energy crisis became apparent. A part of Daffy Panda boarded the Curvature Flyer to return to Earth with the Omix instruments and Orpheus, who had mastered all five waveforms. They will take the vast Omix energy with them and bring new hope and vitality to the Earth.
