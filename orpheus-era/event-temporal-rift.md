# Event: Temporal Rift

## **Event Storyline:**

A mysterious phenomenon has appeared on the city's skyline - a Temporal Rift that is as awe-inspiring as it is weird. A steady stream of manifested Omix energy flows out from the rift, illuminating the sky. However, the city below is not an indifferent spectator to this spectacle. Once the released Omix energy dispersed, it spread like stardust around every corner.

&#x20;

Citizens curiously reach out to touch this newfound energy. However, a group of unexpected adversaries appears - mysterious Orpheus visions. These ghostly Orpheus visions, also wielding the powerful Omix energy, transformed it into ethereal harmonies that formed pulsating sound waves. Those inadvertently come into contact with these sound waves will be swept up in a musical vortex like a heavenly, dizzying whirlpool.

&#x20;

Now, the Daffy Pandas are faced with a choice: challenge the mysterious visions of Orpheus and save the city, or watch from the sidelines as the town becomes a mix of wonder and danger.

As energy continues to emerge from the Temporal Rift, the city's fate hangs in the balance, awaiting the courage and creativity of the Pandas to unlock the mysteries hidden in the Temporal Rift.

&#x20;

## **Event Description:**

From time to time, energy bodies will be refreshed around the rift. Players will be introduced to a PVE scenario when they touch these energy bodies. In this scenario, players must lead their Orpheus team and fight against the Orpheus inside the energy bodies. These energy bodies are varied, and players must burn VSTs to convert them into energy to protect themselves from entering and challenging the visions.

&#x20;

The size of the Energy Body is directly related to the strength of the Orpheus inside. The larger the Energy Body, the more VSTs players need to burn to challenge it, and the more Energy Points they earn.

&#x20;

As the global total of Energy Points gradually accumulates, the cracks in the scenario will widen progressively. It causes the Orpheus Phantom within the Energy Body to slowly level up and become more powerful.

&#x20;

Before the challenge, the combat power of the Orpheus within the energy body is unknown. If the player loses the challenge, they will receive fewer points. At this time, the energy body will not disappear. Still, it will display the battle power and other information about the Orpheus Phantom, including Orpheus information, station position, elements, etc.
