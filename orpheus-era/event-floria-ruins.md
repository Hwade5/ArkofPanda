# Event: Floria Ruins

## **Event Storyline:**

In the depths of the unknown space, a mysterious crystal is suspended in the air, shining with eerie light. Under the influence of extraordinary energy, the Daffy Pandas chased and fought their way to this place. This crystal contains the ultimate secret of Planet Utopia and becomes the focus of exploration. The Daffy Pandas learned this was the key to the lost ruins through ancient inscriptions.

The key can only lead a portion of the people into the City of Light (Floria), revealing the hidden secrets of Utopia's ancient ancestors and touching the mysteries of the endless treasures. Catalyzed by particular energies, the Daffy Pandas begin another round of contention.

## **How to Play:**

Battle of the Ring:

* There are several strongholds set up in the scene. The occupied defenses can increase points for the labels they belong to every once in a while, and the more defenses they control, the more points they increase (1+1ï¼ž2), and when the points are settled, the strongholds will also increase additional points for the labels they control at this time.
* Players need to form a team (the players in the team need to be from the same label) to challenge the stronghold guardian. The challenge is a ring battle; the players decide the order of appearance and then go to the battlefield to fight. The player who defeats the current opponent retains the current life value and continues to fight against the next player who appears on the battlefield until all the players of one side have been eliminated.
* Strongholds (Strongholds provide points to the belonging team at intervals and an additional bonus point to the current stronghold owner at settlement.)
* Orpheus Ties (Designated Orpheus can be on the field simultaneously to activate a tie).
* Bonus Points (PVP points will be added to the player's score, so it's best to have a solid team to fight against.)
