Players can participate in the ORPHEUS TRIAL gameplay (PVE) by owning Orpheus.

Players can deploy up to 5 Orpheus at a time.

ORPHEUS TRIAL has multiple chapters, and players start by challenging the first chapter. They must complete all normal stages in the current chapter to unlock the next one.

After winning normal stages, players can obtain materials. Every 3 normal stages passed unlock an elite stage, which requires spending PT to participate. Winning can earn equipment blueprints, used to unlock higher-level equipment

Participating in battles requires spending 6 stamina points, which recovers over time. Stamina recovers 1 point every 6 minutes, with a maximum limit of 120 points.
