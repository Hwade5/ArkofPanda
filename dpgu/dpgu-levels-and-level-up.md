# DPGU Levels & Level-up

1. DPGU has 10 levels, with the initial level being 1. Players can consume a DPGU of the same level to upgrade the current level of their DPGU;
2. DPGU holders can claim VST rewards daily at Daffy Citadel;
3. DPGU holders can claim exclusive DPGU airdrops at Daffy Citadel (available once for each level from 1 to 10);
4. The invitation relationship of the DPGU consumed for upgrading will also transfer to the upgraded DPGU account;
5. DPGU upgrades are one-way and irreversible. The DPGU account and its assets consumed during the upgrade process will be sent to a black hole. Therefore, please ensure that all assets in the consumed DPGU account are withdrawn before upgrading;
