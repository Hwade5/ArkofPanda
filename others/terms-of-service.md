Multi-accounting is the process where 1 player has access to multiple accounts whether it be on the same or different blockchain address.

To ensure fair gameplay, a person can only ever play on 1 account. It is fine to own multiple NFTs, but it is a violation to play and make progress on multiple accounts.

#### Can I play on the same device as someone else?

To be safe, we recommend not playing on the same device as someone else.

You should never share the same crypto keys/accounts as someone. This is a huge risk for yourselves and your account
