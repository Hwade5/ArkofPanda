# Withdrawals

Players' tokens, assets, and collectibles are all held within their Ark of Panda accounts. When you wish to transfer your assets or sell them on the secondary market, you will need to withdraw the resources to your personal wallet.

## How do you withdraw tokens and items?

Considering the direction of enhancing user engagement, preventing abuse and bot operations, reducing token circulation pressure, and encouraging long-term investment development, we have set the method for players to withdraw as "Pet Withdrawal" - players can withdraw tokens by cultivating their Orpheus pets and reaching a certain power level, then performing token withdrawal operations through the in-game wallet.

&#x20;

Every item within Ark of Panda can be identified as a token on the BNB blockchain. This means you can share all the items you've upgraded and crafted while playing the game.

&#x20;

When you withdraw items, they will be sent to your personal wallet. You can view these items on BscScan. Before withdrawing, make sure you have synchronized your progress on the chain. Any progress not synchronized to the blockchain may be lost.

&#x20;

Players must ensure they have synced their progress on the chain before withdrawing. Any progress not synced to the blockchain may be lost.

## Fee System

When withdrawing from Ark of Panda, players are subject to a 10% transaction fee and a certain amount of time delay. The platform will charge the fee ranging from 4% to 5%, with your inviter receiving 5%, and the DPGU holder in the invitation chain receiving 1%.

The purpose of this is to:

* Stabilize the economy
* Give back to holders
* Suppress click farmers
* Support and encourage original musicians
