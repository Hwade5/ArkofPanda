# Tokenomics

The lack of practicality is one of the key issues affecting the long-term viability of blockchain games. Additionally, once early investors start withdrawing funds, games that focus solely on creating a money-making economy without considering playability may struggle to maintain player interest.

Ark of Panda is fundamentally designed for long-term playability, requiring continuous development and the introduction of new features. The core ethos of Ark of Panda is to explore different approaches to address the typical sustainability challenges of blockchain games. Our goal is to iteratively build the MetaVerse through early releases, gathering feedback, and iterating the game. Currently, the tokenomics design is in its initial phase.

### Our Solutions

1. To break free from the cyclical nature of traditional blockchain games, we've introduced the concept of item lifespan within our game. Once an item's lifespan is depleted, it can no longer generate resources. This approach requires players to spend tokens to restore the lifespan of their items if they wish to continue profiting, thereby helping to eliminate potential economic bubbles within the game ecosystem.
2. We allocate 85% of player expenditure towards PT buyback to ensure stability in token circulation. Additionally, 5% is allocated to establish leaderboards, rewarding players who make significant contributions to the game. Furthermore, a portion is reserved to reward the super bands of DPGU users.
3. We've implemented certain features and gameplay mechanics in the game that require the consumption of PT to experience fully. As a result, players who are eager to withdraw tokens early may not fully enjoy the game's content, especially those that offer high-value digital assets.
4. We've also delineated clear and distinct roles for the two tokens, VST and PT, within the game, ensuring that their functionalities and purposes do not overlap. This approach creates a sustainable economic ecosystem, ensuring that players must generate sufficient value and engage with corresponding game content before extracting profits.

## Natural supply\&demand and the Bitcoin mechanism:

Players in the game can only earn PT by crafting and selling equipment. As the number of players in Ark of Panda increases, both the supply and consumption of PT will rise. Consequently, the market value of PT will inevitably fluctuate. However, we will ensure that the overall value of PT steadily increases over time.

Drawing from the principles of natural supply and demand curves and the Bitcoin mechanism, we introduce additional gameplay features in the game that consume PT and incur high gas fees to stabilize the economy. Additionally, to ensure market stability, we periodically initiate token burns on a predetermined quantity of tokens.
