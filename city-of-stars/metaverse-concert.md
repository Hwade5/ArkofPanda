# Metaverse Concert

## Concert Introduction

Musicians stationed at Ark of Panda can have exclusive themed scenes and lighting effects by customizing exclusive meta-universe concerts;

Ark of Panda will hold first concerts and PK concerts regularly;

New tracks that debut in the Metaverse after completing the concert customization will be entered into the first concert's library and performed at the next first concert;

Tracks already part of a debut concert will go into the general library and can be viewed by the audience at regularly scheduled PK concerts.

## **Inaugural Concert**

The first concert will feature at least two brand-new songs as well as concert scenes;

Players can give gifts for a song during the song's performance, and the song that receives the most gifts wins. Players who participate in the victor's bounty will share the entire bounty for that concert in proportion to their contributions.

## **Concert Prize Pool**

Gifts received during the performance of each song in the concert will go into the total prize pool;

At the end of the show, the song that has received the most gifts will win;

All players who participated in the rewarding of the winning song will divide the rewarded amount of the other songs according to the rewarding ratio;

## How to get concert tickets

Tickets are only required to enter the inaugural concert;

Players can purchase tickets at the box office next to the concert portal.

DPGU holders can claim the concert tickets in the exclusive club Daffy Citadel;
