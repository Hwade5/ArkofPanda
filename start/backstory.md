# Backstory

\
The Earth's energy crisis is only 50 years from breaking out, and humanity faces unprecedented challenges. Dr Chen, a Singaporean scientist, is leading a team to research new energy solutions.

After years of unremitting efforts, they discovered a mysterious energy source named "Omix," which resonates with a specific vibration pattern and continues to be converted into other energies, with a conversion rate that surpasses existing technologies.

Dr. Chan's research has attracted the attention of the global scientific community as the countdown to the planet's energy crisis has begun, with only 50 years left to go. She discovered the resonance of the Daffy Panda with Omix through a sensing device, and further research determined that Daffy could release powerful Omix energy.

The discovery sparked controversy, but Dr. Chan was convinced of Omix's potential. She fought for the opportunity to study Daffy, who gradually showed intelligence and understanding.

After years of research, they finally obtained the results of their study on Daffy. They found that Daffy and its community resonate at the highest level and can release powerful Omix energy. This discovery caused a sensation in the global scientific community.

At this critical moment, young scientist Dr. Lee's paper "On the Relationship Between the Distribution Density of Omix in Space and Living Things" was published, revealing the resonance relationship between the distribution density of Omix in different regions and living things.

Through spectroscopic techniques, humans have discovered the planet Utopia in the galaxy Wolf 1061, closer to Earth, where Omix energy is distributed in extremely high density. Humanity decided to send Daffy and his colony to explore the secrets of Planet Utopia and Omix Energy.

Daffy and the other Pandas form an intergalactic vessel and embark on a journey to Utopia, where the countdown to the Earth's energy crisis continues to loom, and the human race's expectations and fears for the future are intertwined. This challenge is full of unknowns but also brings new hope and courage to humanity.
