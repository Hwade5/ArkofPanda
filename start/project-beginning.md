# Project Beginning

## Project Build

The Ark of Panda game is developed using Unity3D and utilizes seamless loading technology and automated creation of game map scenes, creating a completely open world of music.The game utilizes a self-developed Terrain system, Asset Bundle for resource downloading and loading, and Google Protocol Buffers 3 code generation tool. In terms of optimization, various techniques such as Batcher, Log, GPU Instancing, etc., are employed.

&#x20;

In terms of rendering, Scriptable Render Pipeline and Post Process are enabled to enhance visual performance. Additionally, various HDRP effects are extensively applied, including exposure adjustment, tone mapping, subsurface scattering, volumetric lighting, color grading, and lens distortion.

&#x20;

The entire game is built on "3D virtual world" and "Web 3D interactive technology", achieving seamless entry into the music universe and creating a brand-new 3D music world full of massive users, vast scenes, and interactive on-screen experiences.Through continuous optimization and DOTS acceleration technology, a more scalable content is constructed, creating an eternal surreal 3D music environment. Additionally, the game implements information interaction, covering social interactions such as self-expression, chatting, as well as auditory and visual intertwined interactions, enabling players to freely shuttle between reality and virtuality.Users can break free from the limitations of terminals and hardware, enjoying high-definition, large-scale, and interactive 3D experiences, truly achieving seamless transition between reality and virtuality.
