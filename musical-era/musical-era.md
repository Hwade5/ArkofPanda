# Musical Era

## First Arrival in Utopia

Arriving on Utopia for the first time, the Pandas were amazed by the beauty and magnificence of this mysterious planet, and the natural beauty of Utopia and the intensity of the Omix energy gave them a sense of vitality and hope they had never felt before.

&#x20;

On Utopia, the Pandas decided to set up an organization called "Daffy Panda Ganging Up" (DPGU for short) to establish a new home on this strange planet and explore the mysteries of Omix energy. United to face the challenges of the unknown.

&#x20;

As they explore Utopia more deeply, the Panda is surprised to find that the density of Omix energy distribution here is far beyond their imagination. It means that Planet Utopia could be a massive energy treasure trove, and the abundance of Omix energy is expected to solve Earth's energy crisis.

&#x20;

To make better use of these powerful Omix energies, the Panda began to study the resonance relationship between Omix and living things. Drawing on Dr. Lee's paper, they discovered that some organisms on Planet Utopia had a stronger resonance with Omix energy. This discovery aroused the Panda's keen interest, and they believed that these creatures might possess a deeper connection to Omix.

&#x20;

In their ongoing research, the Panda finally invented the "Omix Instrument." The instrument absorbs nearby Omix energy and transforms it into a unique musical wave. The resonance of these musical fluctuations with the Omix energy triggers a weak reaction in the Omix, which releases the energy it contains.

&#x20;

The invention of the Omix instrument became a significant breakthrough, providing the Panda with a way to utilize the Omix energy more efficiently, and the DPGU members began to use the instruments extensively on Utopia, applying them to energy extraction, living and cultural activities to bring prosperity and vitality to the new homeworld.

&#x20;

Despite the many advances the Panda have made on Utopia, the secrets of Omix energy have yet to be fully unlocked, and the DPGU members know that they have a daunting task ahead of them and will need to keep exploring and researching to discover the full potential of Omix energy truly.
