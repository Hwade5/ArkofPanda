It is commonly used for solo, repertory, accompaniment performances, and composing and rehearsing music. By pressing the keys on the keyboard, the player moves the felt-covered mallets inside the piano, which in turn strikes the wire strings to produce sound. The piano has a wide range of tones, bright and clear, rich in change, and expressive solid power. When playing solo, the piano can play various kinds of majestic, broad, and lyrical music, and it can also play cheerful, dexterous, and highly skilled colorful music. In contrast, in the orchestra, it can play a significant role and is often used as an accompanying instrument. The piano is called "the king of musical instruments" because of its rich expression.

A sound synthesizer is an electronic musical instrument that produces sound through an electrical signal instrumentation amplifier and expresses it through speakers or headphones. Synthesizers can mimic naturally occurring sounds (musical instruments such as pianos, electric pianos, flutes, vocals, natural sounds such as ocean waves, etc.) or generate new electronic sounds (timbres). Synthesizers were first applied to popular music in the 1960s. In the 1970s, especially late 1970s, disco music heavily used synthesizers. 1980s pop and dance music often made heavy use of synthesizers. In the 2010s, synthesizers were adopted in many genres of pop, rock, and dance music, and even synthesizer pop was pop music that made heavy use of synthesizers. Contemporary classical music composers of the 21st century have also written using synthesizers. Keyboardists in today's orchestras also tend to play with synthesizers.
