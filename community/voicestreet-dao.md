# VoiceStreet DAO

### Vision

To establish DAO-based metaverse concerts and music games to achieve a "paradigm shift" in the music industry and enter a new era of music.

### DAO Management

All tokens circulating in Ark of Panda's metaverse will be able to participate and vote in the governance of Voice Street DAO based on the proposal's content. Once approved, these features will be implemented. Increase profits for artists, fans and investors by voting on how to maximize Voice Street DAO value, such as NFT mining and reward ranges, random airdrop PT.

### VoiceStreet DAO and musician fans

Voice Street DAO is a bridge between fans and musicians. By participating in Ark of Panda's metaverse, enough VSTs and PTs are generated to send proposals in Voice Street DAO. By being active in Voice Street DAO, fans can influence the timing, content and format of the musician's future meta-universe concerts and VIP custom booths. A new relationship between fans and idols is formed in the web 3.0 paradigm.

Buying a commemorative meta-universe concert NFT big enough to show off is entirely appealing to superfans; for fans flocking to Ark of Panda, pushing up the price of in-game NFT assets, music media novelties accumulate value in the secondary market over time, so they may make more profit through resale. In the future, Voice Street DAO could become one of the main battlegrounds for fans to influence their idols outside of reality. The fees from the trading of these in-universe assets will also be deposited into Voice Street DAO for more musician-related proposals by community activists. The main function of Voice Street DAO at this stage is to provide Ark of Panda players, musicians and fans with game NFT trading, IMO, online events, P2E and other functions to promote the music industry to enjoy the dividends of blockchain and Web3.

For this reason, a dedicated team has been set up within the Ark of Panda team to communicate with players using our discord server.

## Music Association

The Music Association is a player-created organization made up of music lovers. The Music Association constantly issues music-related tasks for members to complete. These tasks require the efforts of all members to support the Music Association and collect valuable rewards. The Music Association creates a more challenging environment by ranking competitions proportionally between groups of players.

### Creation of a music association

Players must reach a certain level and a small fee is required to create a music association. Players can set music association membership requirements to improve the quality of music association membership.

To join a Music Association players can join any Music Association as long as they meet the qualification requirements of the Music Association (e.g. instrument level). Players can also participate by invitation from Music Association members.

### Music Association Rank

Music associations have their levels. The higher the level will unlock more valuable features. Music Associations require a lot of resources to upgrade and require all Music Association members to work hard to collect enough. The music association level also determines the maximum number of music association members.
