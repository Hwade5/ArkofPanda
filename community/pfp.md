# PFP

To build a robust Web3 ecosystem interaction, we have planned out the PFP Continent in the world of Ark of Panda, and established exclusive PFP venues to showcase other Web3 projects and allow players to visit.

Players of Ark of Panda can see various styles of venue buildings on the PFP Continent and enter to visit. Meanwhile, there will be exhibition platforms for various rare NFT products in the venues, allowing players entering the venue to understand the corresponding project's NFT.

Moreover, upon entering the venue, the economic system will automatically switch to the corresponding project's token economic system. Players can experience the entire project's economic cycle through games in the venue, allowing them to experience multiple Web3 projects in one metaverse.

In the future, we will continue to expand the scale of the PFP Continent to accommodate more venues, building a vast Web3 interactive platform, allowing Ark of Panda users to understand high-quality projects and rare digital assets on Web3 platforms right on the PFP Continent.
